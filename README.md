# Airbnb_Hotel_Booking_Analysis
Edunet-VOIS Internship project

## Project Name
**Airbnb_Hotel_Booking_Analysis**

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the **Airbnb Open Dataset** to extract insights on listings, hosts, pricing, and reviews. Using **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations**, we explore how property types, neighborhood groups, and host attributes affect listing performance.

- Explore relationship between **property age and price**  
- Identify **top 10 hosts by listings count**  
- Examine if **verified hosts receive more reviews**  
- Explore **price vs service fee correlation**  
- Calculate **Average Review Rate Number (ARRN)** by neighborhood and room type  
- Study **host listings count vs availability**

## Steps Performed

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Checked for missing values and duplicates  
- Standardized column names (lowercase, underscores)  
- Removed duplicate rows  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualizations
- Count and bar plots for room/property types  
- Listings count by neighborhood group  
- Average price by neighborhood  
- Year built vs price scatter plot  
- Top 10 hosts by listings count  
- Verified hosts vs reviews per month  
- Price vs service fee correlation  
- Grouped bar chart for **average review rate (ARRN)**  
- Host listings count vs availability
